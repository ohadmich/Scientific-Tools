# Scientific_Tools
This repository contains some useful scientific functions that I created for my daily research work. 

Here is a short summary of the tools and some examples of the outputs:
#### Mechanical_dressed_states
This script investigates the mechanical interaction of spin states in an NV center's triplet ground state.
We choose to discuss only the mI=+1 subspace of the nitrogen 14 hyperfine states, and also take into
account additional spin coupling (A) to some spin 1/2 system in the lattice (such as carbon 13).
We compute the energy of dressed states that emerge from a mechanical coupling between the ms=+1 and ms = -1 states (Omega_m),
plot their magnetic field dependance and quantify their protection from magnetic noise.

#### BeamWaistCalc
This code takes an image of a laser beam as an input, fits the data to a 2D Gaussian beam,
plots the fit laid over the data and displays the waist value next to a one standard deviation error size.
